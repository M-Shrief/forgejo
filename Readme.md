# Forgejo

Setting up a Forgejo instance to self-host a Version Control System (VCS), so that we have sovereignty over our code infrastructure using Open-Source software. So that no nation or organization can lock us out of our code, and that we will not have a single point of failure that can be targeted easily.

In short, this project's core objective is to achieve **Strategic Autonomy** by securing our software infrastructure from the control of other parties.

There're multiple examples of using Forgejo for the same reasons, like:

- [Gitee](https://gitee.com/) in China
    > Gitee was chosen by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the Chinese government to make an "independent, open-sourcecode hosting platform for China." [source](https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/china-is-building-its-github-alternative-gitee/)

- [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) in Europe
    > The organization selected the European Union for their headquarters and computer infrastructure, due to members' concerns that a software project repository hosted in the United States could be removed if a malicious actor made bad faith copyright claims under the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act).
