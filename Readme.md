# Forgejo

Setting up a Forgejo instance to self-host a Version Control System (VCS), so that we have sovereignty over our code infrastructure using Open-Source software. So that no nation or organization can lock us out of our code, and that we will not have a single point of failure that can be targeted easily.

In short, this project's core objective is to achieve **Strategic Autonomy** by securing our software infrastructure from the control of other parties.
